## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currenty working on my master thesis where I am analysing the research question 'Are current EU regulations on political micro-targeting sufficient to prevent unlawful political influence and safeguard democratic integrity?'. 

Within this thesis I am writing a case study where I am analysing the rise of Die Linke in the federal election 2025 in Germany. I therefor have used a code from Bellingcat and adjusted it for my purpose. This code is published on my GitHub profile, so everyone interested can see it.

For the future, I hope that I can build more things like this!
